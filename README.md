# What is Plan Your Trip ?

![](https://github.com/ahsanatzapier/react-plan-your-trip/blob/main/src/assets/logo.svg)

Plan Your Trip is a fun and simple solo or collaborative trip planning app. It uses React for UI development and Firebase for the database. The app is hosted on Netlify. When a user starts a new trip, they are granted a random "TripToken" generated for their unique trip. If they leave the app, they can use the token to return to their unique trip and keep planning it. The user can also share this "TripToken" with others for collaborative trip planning. The application takes the user location input and uses the FourSquare API to find points of interest at that location. The user can then add the desired points of interest from that location to their trip before searching for a new location and adding additional points of interest from there. A trip can have points of interest from any one number of locations. Users can also remove the points of interest from their trip if they are no longer interested in it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
